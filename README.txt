ColoredFolders

A DLL File that contains 44 unique colors of folder icons.

If you're unaware of how to use DLL Icons, or any custom icons:

- In the right click context menu, select the "Properties" option.
-Click on the "Customize" tab if you're changing the icon of a folder, and "Shortcut" if you're managing a shortcut's icons.
-Select "Change Icon". Navigate to the icon file or DLL of your choice.
-Choose your icon from the list below if you selected a dll.

Note: The icons start at the number 11 because of the way that DLLs and all resource files handle numbers (I had to manually go through and remake the entire library after discovering this)
